# Predicting Property Price Outcomes in Australia

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether Australian homes (Feb 2022â€“Feb 2023) sell above or below their listing price. The dataset includes 4,937 properties with structured and text features from real estate listings.

## Methods
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering.
- **Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM, with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation:** 5-fold cross-validation, F1-score as the main metric.

## Results
- **Random Forest** performed best (F1: 84.7%), leveraging both structured and text features.
- Text features (emotional intensity, readability, keywords) improved prediction accuracy.

## Key Takeaway
Random Forest with advanced text features is recommended for accurate, interpretable property price predictions in Australian real estate.
